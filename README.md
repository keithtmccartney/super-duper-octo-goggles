# super-duper-octo-goggles
A .NET command-line based rate calculation system.

## What's inside, right now?

This is a .NET Command-Line Application.

## What's to be done, in the future?

More testing is needed; a general clean-up of single-responsibility could be applied, there's a little bit of replication in here.

I'm implemented BDD here through the use of SpecFlow; this is made up of a Feature file that contains some Testing Scenarios where a final Step Definition output is available for Testing.

## Okay, fair enough, how do I run the thing?

* There are 2 arguments to be passed through, they are...

A file-path;

A loan amount;

E.g: ...Folder\Sub-Folder\market.csv 1000

## Cool, how do I test the thing?

Load the Visual Studio Test Explorer, and run each individual Test.
